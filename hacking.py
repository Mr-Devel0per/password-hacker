# This program is offered for use with the Science Buddies project idea
# "How Easily Can Your Password Be Hacked?" which lets you explore the
# makeup of a good password. This program will help you understand some
# methods that people use to guess other people's passwords. To see detailed written
# instructions for this project, visit

#
# If you use this program, or a modified version of it, for a science project,
# make sure to credit Science Buddies. Using somebody else's code without giving
# them credit is plagiarism, just like if you copied their writing.
#
# You'll notice that several parts of the code have places where 
# print() functions have been turned into comments. You might want to uncomment
# these print statements when debugging your program (or add more of your own in
# other places), but they will make your program run slower. There are also many lines
# that pause the program using input() statements. This gives you a chance to read
# the output and understand how the program works. Once your program is
# working, you can comment out these print() and input() statements to make it run faster.

# is just initializing the variables. Scroll down to the "main" function at the bottom
# of the program, where you can edit password0 to test out different algorithms.
# The other passwords (1-6) were created by Science Buddies and "hidden" using
# something called hashing. This prevents you from "cheating" by knowing the
