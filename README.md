### Password-Hacking Bot

I use a program called selenium to open chrome and use commands (click, sendkeys). I'm pretty sure that this bot is illegal if you use it on legitimate websites, and it probably won't work anyway, so don't try it

Running the password-hacking bot will open up google chrome and automatically go to https://Zach-The-Gecko.github.io/test-site/. it will then run a program made by sciencebuddies

for more information on the methods used and the original code, go to [ScienceBuddies.org](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/CompSci_p046/computer-science/password-security-how-easily-can-your-password-be-hacked#summary)

in script.js, you will see a line of code that goes like this: ```if (input.value == "password"){```

The ```"password"``` is the password my bot tries to crack. You can change this if you would like.
